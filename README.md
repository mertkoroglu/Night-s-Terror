## Night's Terror

**Night's Terror** is a survival game developed using the Unity game engine. Step into the eerie world where you must protect your pond from lurking horrors throughout the night.

### Features:

- **Turret Management:** Power on/off turrets to defend against monsters.
- **Repair System:** Click on damaged turrets to repair them and keep your defenses strong.
- **Resource Collection:** Collect energy cells dropped by enemies to gain extra energy.
- **Dynamic Camera:** Use A and D keys to change camera positions and monitor the entire battlefield.
- **Survival Challenge:** Survive the 2-minute night to win the game. Be cautiousâ€”if a turret is completely destroyed, the game ends.
- **Energy Strategy:** Each turret uses energy, so manage them carefully. Closing all turrets gains you energy, and energy will renew over time if depleted.
